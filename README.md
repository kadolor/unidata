# unidata

Unidata is a Python library geared towards helping university research assistants with automating the cleaning of low quality data sets in preparation for advanced machine learning analysis.

Importing the `unidata` module allows you to use the `unidata` module's functions to automate the data cleaning process. 

The `unidata` module leverages the Pandas library to create DataFrames. DataFrames are very helpful in managing data with rows and columns. With Pandas commands, we can perform mathematical operations on columns, reorganize columns, and format values in columns.
